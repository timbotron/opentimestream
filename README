Phase One:
Crazy Simple.  User is hard-coded in, no login. Ability to add a todo item, and view todo items in simple list.

Phase Two:
User Creation and login.  Ability to create calendar(s), set private y/n.  Add Event functionality, view in simple list.

Phase Three:
iCalendar feed generation (ex. /feed/ical/username/calname).  Using caching on feed.  Make List (Backpackit) view, with checkboxes for todo items.  JQuery, disapear when checked.

Phase Four:
User Account settings: timestamp preferred, etc.  Various calendaring views; modular.
